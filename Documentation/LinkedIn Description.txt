This is my course project for the "Practical Robotics & Smart Things" course in FMI. It is my first robotics project and I am really excited to share it with you. Even though it is fairly simple, considering the current state of the field of robotics, it has been a truly eye-opening experience for me. It has shown me the career path I want to follow. 

You can find the full documentation on my Github page.
