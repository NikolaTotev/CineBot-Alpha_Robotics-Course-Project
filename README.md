# Project Cinebot Alpha 

This is the documentation for my Robotics Course Project created during my second year, second semester in FMI for the course Practical Robotics and Smart "Things". 

## *Acknowledgements*
Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge my parents, for their constant love and encouragement, not only for this project, but for all of my previous and current envdeavours. Without them this project would not be the same.
I would also like to thank the teachers the teachers that guided me though the skills I needed to learn in order to make this project a reality. 
In no particular order I'd like to thank
Dr. Ivan Chavdarov, for teaching me the skills related to 3D modelling & printing, as well as giving me guidance on my structural design by telling me what could be improved and how such things are usually made/designed.
and
Trayan Iliev, for expanding my horizons on the subjects of IoT and the software side of robotics.
